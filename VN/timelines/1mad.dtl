annie: That's it. This writing is so bad I can't believe you're the same author who created my beloved Misery.
annie: After all I'm doing for you this is how you repay me?\
This is how you would treat your biggest fan?
[signal arg_type="dict" arg="{"index":"0","scene":"3","type":"new_choices"}"]
- Sorry
	paul: Sorry, I...\
It was not my intention.
- I'm having trouble focusing | [else="disable"]
	paul: I'm having trouble focusing on the story.\
It feels as though there is a fog in my brain.
- This loneliness is overwhelming | [else="disable"]
	paul: This loneliness is overwhelming.\
Aren't the roads open alredy?
- I will do better
	paul: I will do better, Annie.\
I promise i will fix this, for you... And for Misery
- Trust me, I will fix this
	paul: Oh dear, you are right.\
Just place your trust in me, i will make this right. I will give Misery what she deserves.
paul: It's been hard to find the right words with this pain.
annie: Listen to me Paul, I want no excuses.\
No hospital would treat you as good as I'm doing - not that the roads are open, anyways.
annie: And you better revise this sorry excuse for a chapter you wrote today.\
Give Misery the story she deserves. 
annie: In fact, I have some ideas that could take this story to a whole other level.
annie: For the ending, Geoffrey and Ian could compete for Misery's love through a sword duel.\
How passionate! Don't you think that's a good idea?
[signal arg_type="dict" arg="{"index":"1","scene":"3","type":"normal"}"]
- I have my own ideas
	paul: I have different things planned for Misery's character arc.\
I can only ask you to wait and see.
	annie: ...
	annie: We'll see what you come up with, then.\
*scoffs*

- The final decision is mine
	paul: That sounds good, Annie. You've got potential as a writer.\
I'm afraid, however, that the final decision is mine to make.
	annie: Oh, thank you.\
I'm dying to see what awaits for Misery.
	set {ENDING_NEUTRAL} += 1
- That's such a good idea! | [if {TRUE} == false] [else="disable"]
	paul: That's such a good idea!\
I can alredy picture it, a fair duel for the damisel's hand... How come i didn't think of it earlier?\\
...You'll have to wait to know who wins in the end, though.
	annie: See? I knew you would agree.\
You're a genius writer, after all.
	set {ENDING_HAPPY} += 1
annie: Let's continue tomorrow, shall we? You've got to rest now.
