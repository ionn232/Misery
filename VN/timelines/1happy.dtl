annie: This quiet and solitary ambience has a special sort of feeling...\
Paul, might it have been the spark that ignited your creativity to produce such fantastic writing today?

- You were
	paul: My inspiration was you, Annie.
- You're right
	paul: You're right. It's the perfect ambience for writing, away from any distraction.
- No, I feel stuck here
annie: Oh Paul, you're too sweet.
annie: I have some ideas that could take this story to a whole other level.
annie: For the ending, Geoffrey and Ian could compete for Misery's love through a sword duel. \
How passionate! Don't you think that's a good idea?

	paul: I have different things planned for Misery's character arc.\
I can only ask you to wait and see.
	annie: ...
	annie: We'll see what you come up with, then.\

- The final decision is mine
	paul: That sounds good, Annie. You've got potential as a writer.\
I'm afraid, however, that the final decision is mine to make.
	annie: Oh, thank you.\
I'm dying to see what awaits for Misery.
	set {ENDING_NEUTRAL} += 1
- That's such a good idea!
	paul: That's such a good idea!\
I can alredy picture it, a fair duel for the damisel's hand... How come i didn't think of it earlier?\
...You'll have to wait to know who wins in the end, though.
	annie: See? I knew you would agree.\
You're a genius writer, after all.

annie: Let's continue tomorrow, shall we? You've got to rest now.
